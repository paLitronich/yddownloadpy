Simple dowloader YouTube videos and audio

--- Notes for Linux/macOS ---
tkinter is usually installed via package manager, not pip:
sudo apt-get install python3-tk

yt-dlp requires ffmpeg for video/audio processing:
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg

--- Notes for Windows ---
tkinter is included in the standard Python installation, no extra steps needed.
ffmpeg must be installed separately and added to PATH:
https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
